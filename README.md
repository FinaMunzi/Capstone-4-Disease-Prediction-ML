An analysis of the Singapore public housing, Housing Development Board (HDB) resale prices from the year 2017 onwards.
The interactive dashboard shows the sales exercise based on region and flat types.
1.	Funnel chart to distinguish the total resale transaction in the town based on the region. It is achievable by using slicer with region.
2.	Column chart shows the timeline of the resale transactions quarterly based on annual data against the town. 
3.	Column charts display the maximum resale price on each town based on the flat model. By selecting the town on the slicer, the charts display the transacted price for each flat model.
4.	Bar charts point out the number of transactions based on storey range for each flat type. The slicer was used to filter the storey range against the flat type. 
The charts demonstrate the patterns of the sales exercise of HDB resales from the year 2017 onwards to current date. It allows us to understand the regional sales and the current demand of the type of units which are available in resale market.  


## I've learned that :
__________________________________________________________________________

•	The analysis shows the uptrend price and demand in the HDB resale market.

•	The 4 room units were favourable as compared to smaller or larger units.

•	Most of the HDB resale transactions was done in Q3.

•	More sales in year 2018.

•	High transaction trends are mostly from matured estates with improved, maisonettes, or premium loft apartment type of flat model.

•	Lower level units were the most transaction because of the majority resale units are older flats and it does not have high storey range comparing to newly MOP-ed BTO units.

•	Most of the HDB resale transaction was made in the central region of Singapore. There are many reasons for this pattern. Located proximity to central region, easy access to CBD and nearby prestigious schools to name a few.

## Changes made from original data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

•	Data cleaning – added year, region, and zone into the data, corrected the error with #NA regions to the relevant region.

•	Merged the list of storeys range from 18 list to 9 list.

•	Used index-match formula for region and zone to match the town in data cleaning sheet. 

•	Proper function to correct the header.

•	Created pivotable and charts.

•	Added slicer and timeline.

•	Created interactive dashboard.

## Reflections
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The analysis of realtime data allows me to understand on the trends and demand of current market or needs. There were too many data to choose from the open source, and I chosed HDB as I would like to understand more on the the current seller's market and buyer's demand to get a unit due to the slowdown of housing construction. As pandemic and inflation hit the economy, the entire cost have been affected including the resales of HDBs.

The interactive dashboard allows me to compare the data, filter the data and focus on specific interest when need to. When we have big data file, interactive dashboard make it easy to read the data.
